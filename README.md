Description:

    *  Design a simplistic account system to store account numbers, passwords and points
    *  The project did not receive much update since it was redundant

    *  Basic Python knowledge
    *  Use of the dictionaries and lists

Comments:

    *  This project was used as a prototype for my Critical and Analytical Thinking (CAT) course
    *  It hadn't been used so it was scrapped
    *  I keep it to see my progress
